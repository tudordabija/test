2 web servers provisioned using vagrant+ansible and 1 docker container nginx proxy LB in front of them.

It should work on macOs as it checks/install all required tools (docker vagrant virtualbox)

Made this one more for fun and was interested on checking how ansible integrates with vagrant.

bin/start-all.sh creates the entire infrastructure
